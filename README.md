# Algnite - Building the Foundation

Welcome to the Algnite repository! We're currently in the exciting phase of building the foundational structure for our company's online presence.

## Current Development Focus

Our team is working diligently on the initial key pages of our website:

* **Home Page:** I am currently developing the core landing experience for Algnite, aiming to provide a clear introduction to our company and its mission.
* **Services Page:** Alongside the home page, I'm also building the services page to detail the offerings Algnite will provide.
* **Contact Page:** Avaneesh is taking the lead on creating the contact page, ensuring visitors have a straightforward way to get in touch with us.
* **Book Page:** Avaneesh is also developing the book page, which we anticipate will be crucial for [briefly mention the purpose of the book page, e.g., scheduling consultations, accessing resources].

## Next Steps

As we progress, we'll be focusing on:

* Integrating the individual page components.
* Establishing a consistent design language across all pages.
* Adding more content and features to each section.

## Stay Tuned!

This repository will evolve as we build and refine our online presence. We're excited about this initial phase and look forward to sharing our progress.
