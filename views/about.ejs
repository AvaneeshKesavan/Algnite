                <h2>It All Began in Jaffna</h2>
                <p>
                  During a visit to Jaffna, we witnessed something that would change
                  our lives forever - elderly people left behind, alone, with no one
                  to care for them. Some were struggling with dementia, others with
                  basic daily needs, all with the profound loneliness that comes
                  from being forgotten.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As a son, I couldn't bear seeing our elders suffer this way. And
                  this wasn't just in Jaffna - it's a heartbreaking reality across
                  Sri Lanka. That's when we knew we had to do something.

                  Delaksan Sritharan, a compassionate soul who has dedicated his
                  life to serving others. His journey in humanitarian work began
                  with Manitha Neyam Trust, where he volunteered extensively,
                  helping those in desperate need.

                <p>
                  But the plight of Sri Lanka's forgotten elders called for
                  something more. What started as one man's mission has grown into a
                  movement, thanks to the incredible team that joined along the way.

              <p>
                We believe every elder deserves dignity, care, and love in their
                golden years. No one should face old age alone, forgotten by the
                society they helped build.
              </p>

              <p>
                Through direct aid, community programs, and raising awareness, we're
                working to change how Sri Lanka cares for its elders. But we can't
                do it alone.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is more than charity - it's our duty as children, as neighbors,
                as human beings. Join us in giving our elders the life they deserve.
